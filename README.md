### Hey there, I am Aarushi! <img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/hvRJCLFzcasrR4ia7z/giphy.gif" width="27px">

My pronouns are (they/them). I am a final year undergraduate student studying B.A. Hons (Humanities and Social Sciences) from the University of Delhi.

My minor degree is in **Journalism** and with the help of my unique research oriented course, I have designed my curriculum to suit my interest areas and focus on **media**, **gender**, **social** and **political theories**.


I'll be working with **Nazariya** over the course of summer 2021.

I am actively exploring my options for pursuing higher studies, preferably in one of my interest areas, and if possible, at their intersection.
